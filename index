        <h1>Welcome to Iggy Rose's Website</h1>
        <p>My pink shallow palace. The castle Mario said "Screw you, bitch" to Princess Peach for.</p>
        <p>They say I'm sweet as sugar and hard as ice; hurt me once, and you'll see the price. A monk once told me I came to the world to change it.</p>
        <p>This is MY home, where vanity is exposed for what it TRULY is. The culprit behind it all.</p>
        <p>It's obvious I'm not a superstar, and I couldn't care less about the opinions of those whoâ€™ve never spoken to me. Burn the magazines and turn off MTV. Throw everything out the window.</p>
        <p>In a society where there's no reason to type, speak, love, or bleed, give me a break. You are consumed by vanity. Your future has been commercialized, plasticized, and verified. This is the reality we live in. This is you.</p>
        <p>Keep staying afloat in this shallow world. I'll keep doing my thing.</p>
